# Bloodgence
Bloodgence - Why to ignore road accident when you can help anonymously?

Award-winning project for Google I/O 2015.

On the occasion of Google I/O 2015, Hackathon was organized at Innovaccer, Noida. This was my first hackathon and went only to have free food and to get free stuff, those days. Eventually, after lot many discussion, we (my hackathon team - Zesters +Soubhik and +Sumanyu) planned to first tackle problem around us. So we came up with an idea to help road accident victims.

People in India, they want to help an accident victim, but just because of fear of involvement of Police, they try to neglect. So what we come up was, what if we could tackle this barrier of getting into police interrogation. Hence we planned to build Bloodgence. Blood + Emergency = Bloodgence that also has a collaboration with various blood bank to get blood in stock if need.

What bloodgence do? It's a web app, made on PHP as a backend with MySQL as DB and js and HTML on the front, featuring to help victims of a road accident. It has a photo capture feature that will capture a photo of road accident victims or accident victim and gets it's geolocation and sends to nearest hospitals in a range of 20km. If no hospitals in a range of 20km, it will increase its radius radar +5km and so on. And as soon as Hospitals are located in a specified range, a notification with geolocation and image uploaded would be triggered. Hence cutting the time for the arrival of an ambulance.

Can't we upload photo from file manager? - Asked by Panel members, No, you cant upload images from storage, it will trigger camera only and for future we would be using - Watson IBM service to integrate image recognision to auto detect the event being accident or not.
